## Azure 101

**Abstract:** 'There is no cloud, it's just someone else's computerâ€¦' That is true. But when this someone else is Microsoft, and takes care of all the maintenance of these huge server farms, you can redirect these resources used to take care of your own infrastructure to other important tasks, such as adding features for your users. However, at first sight, Microsoft Azure and its huge offering can seem daunting for a new user. In this presentation, Laurent Bugnion, a Cloud Developer Advocate with Azure will show you how he got started and how you too can take advantage of the services that the Microsoft Cloud has to offer. Together we will discover the Azure Portal as well as quite a few tools that make your life as a cloud developer easier
